This project aims to analyze the Amazon Customer Review Data and derive meaningful insights from it.
 We make graphical representation of how the average of review rating changes as a function of time. This is done by taking annual average of review scores in each class(high score, medium score, low score) and then plot as a function of year. We also analyze what items resulted in the increase in score and what resulted in the decrease in score. This is done by finding the unique items and finding the total review score for each unique item. The item "AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries(36 Count)" contributed most to the high scores. While items like "AmazonBasics Double-Door folding Metal Dog Crate", "AmazonBasics Silicone Hot Handle Cover/Holder-Red", "Echo Dot(Previous Generation) etc. contributed the least.                                   
The code used is also provided. Anyone is welcome to make improvements on the current version of the project.
